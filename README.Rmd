# DataExplorer

The goal of DataExplorer is to enable user to explore and visualize historical data from the Borealis database. The app enables user to visualize the metadata for the data, check the structure of raw data, see some basic descriptive statistics and plot the data. 

## Installation

You can install DataExplorer package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("agrifooddatacanada/OAC_Historical_Research_Data_Explorer_App/tree/dev")
```
## Run the app on your local computer

You can also run the app directly on your local computer using:

``` r
DataExplorer::run_app()
```

## Acknowledgement

This shiny web application was developed as a part of the Reusable research data made shiny workshop that was held at the University of Guelph, Guelph Ontario Canada.




```{r example}
library(DataExplorer)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
