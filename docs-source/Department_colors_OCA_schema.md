**Name**: Department_colors  
**Description**: The department_colors file contains a color mapping for different department names. It plays a key role in the network visualization feature of the RED-X application, helping users distinguish between different departments using color-coded nodes. Each keyword or author node inherits a color from this mapping based on its associated department. This improves visual clarity and makes it easier to spot patterns across departments in the research network.
