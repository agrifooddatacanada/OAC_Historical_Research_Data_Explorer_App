<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of DataExplorer is to enable user to explore and visualize
historical data from the Borealis database. The app enables users to
visualize the metadata for the data, check the structure of raw data,
see some basic descriptive statistics and plot the data.


## Acknowledgement

## About the App

RED-X supports the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), helping users:

- Discover reusable datasets from agri-environmental research

- Visualize relationships between datasets, authors, and keywords

- Filter data by college, department, or research center

- Navigate and explore studies in a clean, structured layout

## App Overview

The application consists of four primary tabs:

## 1. Home Tab
