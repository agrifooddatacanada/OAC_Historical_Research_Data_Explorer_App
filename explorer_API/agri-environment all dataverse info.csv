The Food from Thought program is funded in part for a 7-year term from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF), a Tri-Agency initiative. In 2018, these two programs established new funding requirements, requiring a data management plan (DMP) for approved research projects at the University of Guelph. These requirements centred on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of research projects through the implementation of sound data stewardship practices when collecting, analyzing, storing, preserving, and, when possible, sharing research data. As part of the funders’ commitment to improved data stewardship, each approved research project would include the submission of a DMP to the relevant funder. A suite of support services and resources were developed as a collaborative pilot project between the Library and the Office of Research to assist researchers in meeting the new requirements. Central to this project was the design of an online agri-food DMP template.The scope for this project included research funded between September 2018 until December 2019 covering 106 Alliance research projects and 45 Food from Thought projects. This pilot project built upon existing local RDM support and is based on identified international best practices. Following the end of the pilot project, a review was undertaken by the Office of Research, Agri-Food Partnership and the Library to assess the value and effectiveness of the RDM supports with particular emphasis on the efficacy of the DMP template and rollout.

Experiments in which socially deprived juvenile male mammals develop into sexually incompetent adults, along with widespread sexual dimorphism in rough-and-tumble play (R and T), suggest that R and T may prepare juvenile males for adult sexual behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal study of American mink (Neovison vison) on two farms, w ith two cohorts each. For males (n = 121), we predicted that individuals with the highest frequencies of rough-and-tumble play as juveniles (10-20 weeks old) would, as adults, show shorter latencies to bite females' necks and to begin copulating, and copulate for longer durations. On one farm, we conducted a pilot study of females (n = 10) as a preliminary test of the hypothesis that R and T also prepares females for adult sexual behaviour. Here, our predictions were the opposite of those for males, since abilities to limit the number or duration of copulations could allow females to exercise pre- or post-copulatory mate choice. In total, we observed 1669 male-female encounters, and 1004 separate copulations. As predicted, frequent juvenile R and T predicted long-lasting copulations in adult males, and also longer latencies to copulate in adult females. This was true specifically of rough-and-tumble play itself, independently of general activity levels and, among a subset of 32 males reared in environmentally enriched housing, also independently of solitary object play. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that juvenile rough-and-tumble play predicts adult sexual behaviour in any species. Further research is required to test whether our female results can be replicated, and, importantly, to determine whether play truly has a causal role in either of these correlational relationships.","Ahloy Dallaire, Jamie and Mason, Georgia J.

Intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation are common traits of these disorders. FP is, therefore, proposed to be a behavioral consequence of dysregulated communication between the gut and the brain. Probiotic supplementation represents a promising new therapeutic to mitigate widespread FP. We monitored FP, gut microbiota composition, immune markers and amino acids related to the production of neurochemicals with Lactobacillus rhamnosus supplement (Lacto) or a placebo in laying hens. Data demonstrate that, when stressed, the incidence of FP increased significantly, however, Lacto prevented this increase. Lacto showed strong immunological effects by increasing the regulatory T cell population of the spleen and the cecal tonsils, in addition to limiting cecal microbiota dysbiosis. Despite minimal changes of aromatic amino acid levels, data suggest that catecholaminergic circuits may be an interesting target for further studies. Overall, our findings provide the first data supporting the use of a single-strain probiotic to reduce stress-induced FP in chickens and has promise to improve the welfare of domestic birds.","Mindus, C., van Staaveren, N., Bharwani, A. et al.

After weaning, pigs were placed in 24 pens (6 pigs per pen) and pens were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments (study d 0; n = 6), which were fed over 3 phases (phases I, II, and III were fed for 7, 14, and 21 days, respectively). Two nursery diets were formulated with 25% (LowFF) and 50% (HighFF) of the animal protein sources replaced by full fat BSFLM. Conventional nursery diets including animal protein sources without (CON-) and with antibiotics (220 mg Aureomycin per kg of complete feed; CON+) served as controls. On day 8, two pigs per pen were sacrificed to collect organ weights and for intestinal histomorphological measurements. On days 9 and 23, two pigs per pen were vaccinated with the novel antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Blood samples were collected on days 9, 23, and 38 to assess concentrations of plasma haptoglobin and OVA-specific immunoglobulins G (IgG) and IgG1.

Rapid growth may also limit the performance of motivated behaviors, whereas the provision of enrichment may increase these behaviors and general activity. This study aimed to evaluate the inactivity, behavior patterns, and enrichment use of 2 fast- (CONV) and 12 slower-growing broiler strains (categorized as fastest [FAST], moderate [MOD], and slowest slow [SLOW]), based on their growth rates; 4 strains/category]. To evaluate inactivity, one male and one female from 153 pens were outfitted with omnidirectional accelerometers from d 21 until processing (14 −24 birds/strain from 8 to 12 pens/strain). Additionally, to supplement inactivity data, 5-min continuous behavioral observations of four focal birds per pen (2 males, 2 females) were conducted on days 26, 42, and 56 (72−148 observations of 8−12 pens/strain) to quantify the duration and frequency of various behaviors; at the same time, 5 to 11 instantaneous scan samples were also performed for pen-based enrichment use. Inactivity peaked at 78 to 80% of the day for all strains; however, those with slower growth rates reached these levels at older ages. Compared to slower growing strains at the same age, faster growing strains were more inactive, spent more time sitting and feeding, spent less time standing and walking, and used enrichments less; these differences mostly occurred at younger ages. Generally, at the same age, strains with similar growth rates (within the same category) behaved similarly, with only a few exceptions. Results suggest that not all strains identified as “slow-growing” broilers behave differently from fast-growing broilers, nor do they all behave similarly to each other. As such, results suggest that improved broiler welfare, particularly with respect to reduced inactivity, the performance of a wider range of normal, motivated behaviors, and/or increased enrichment use, is related to the broiler strain’s specific growth rate.","Dawson, L.

To investigate effects of growth rate on carcass traits and incidence of myopathies, 14 strains were evaluated, encompassing 2 conventional(CONV; strains B and C: ADG0-48 > 60 g/d)and 12 slower-growing (SL) strains. The latter were categorized based on growth rate: FAST (strains F, G, I and M; ADG0-62=53−55 g/d), MOD (strains E, H, O and S; ADG0-62=50-51 g/d), and SLOW (strains D, J, K and N; ADG0-62<50 g/d). In a randomized incomplete block design, 7,216 mixed-sex birds were equally allocated into 164 pens (44 birds/pen; 30 kg/m2), with each strain represented in 8 to 12 pens over 2 to 3 production cycles. From each pen, 4 males and 4 females were processed at 2 Target Weights (TWs) based on their expected time to reach 2.1 kg BW (TW 1: 34 d for CONV; 48 d for SL strains) and 3.2 kg BW (TW 2: 48 d for CONV; 62 d for SL strains). Weights and yields for the carcass, breast, drumsticks, thighs, and wings were obtained; breast fillets were assessed to determine the presence and severity of WB and WS. At both TWs, breast yield was higher as growth rate increased (P < 0.001), with CONV having greater breast yield than other categories. Strain F had the greatest breast yield at both TWs (P < 0.001) within the FAST category. At TW 2, CONV had the greatest incidence of WB and WS (P < 0.001). However, within FAST, strain F had the greatest incidence of myopathies (P < 0.001) at both TWs, exhibiting values as high or as greater than CONV birds. The incidence of WB and WS in strains with differing growth rates but high breast meat yield suggests that the latter may play a major role in the occurrence of these myopathies.","Santos, M.N., Rothschild, D., Widowski, T.M., Barbut, S., Kiarie, E.G., Mandell, I., Guerin, M.T., Edwards, A.M. and Torrey, S., 2021.

From d 0 to 13, control pens received untreated water (-BSDFM), and 2 treated pens received water and 2 mL x 108 colony forming unit/bird/d (+BSDFM); daily water intake (WI) was recorded. On d 9, birds in half (+Eimeria) of pens per treatment received of 1 mL of Eimeria maxima and Eimeria acervulina oocysts orally, and the other half (-Eimeria) sterile saline solution. Birds had ad libitum access to feed and a water line from d 14. Feed intake (FI), body weight (BW) and mortality were recorded for calculating BW gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). On d 14 and 35, samples of birds were necropsied for organ weight and intestinal measurements. Excreta samples were collected from d 14 to 19 for oocyst count.

The algal oils were: 1) OmegaPro (OPAO) standardized algal oil for DHA content and 2) Crude algal oil (CAO). A total of 400, 46-wk-old Lohmann LSL lite hens were housed in enriched cages (10 birds/cage) and allocated 5 diets (n = 8) for a 12-wk trial. The iso-caloric and -nitrogenous diets were a standard corn and soybean meal diet, standard plus 0.25 or 0.76% OPAO and standard plus 0.23 or 0.69% CAO; algal oils diets supplied similar DHA at each level. Egg production indices (hen day egg production, feed intake, FCR, egg weight, egg mass, and eggshell quality) were monitored for 10 wk. Diet samples were analyzed for fatty acids (FA) on wk 1, 6, and 12 and eggs on wk 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12. At the end of the trial, one hen/cage was weighed and dissected for liver, breast and thigh for FA and long bones for ash content analyses. Concentration of omega-6 to omega-3 FA ratio was 12.9, 6.64, 3.48, 6.96, and 3.59 for standard, 0.23 and 0.76% OPAO, 0.25 and 0.69% CAO, respectively. Algal oils increased (P ≤ 0.046) eggshell thickness linearly. The concentration of DHA in the eggs from the birds fed the standard, 0.23 and 0.76% OPAO, 0.25 and 0.69% CAO was 84, 195, 286, 183, and 297 mg/100g egg, respectively, and algal oils enriched eggs with DHA linearly and quadratically (P ≤ 0.01). In conclusion, algal oils increased the concentration of DHA in eggs and had no adverse effects on egg production and eggshell quality.","Maina, A. N., Lewis, E., and Kiarie, E. G. (2023).

A total of 524-day-old Ross 708 pullets were placed in floor pens (∼24 birds/pen) for the starter (0–4 WOA) and grower (5–18 WOA) phases, then transferred to the egg production facility and redistributed to ∼20 birds/pen for the prelay phase (19–22 WOA). Two diets were allocated to pens (0–18 WOA; n = 11) and (19–22 WOA; n-12). The diets were a control corn and soybean meal diet formulated to meet specifications and control plus 0.05% HY (HY). Birds had ad libitum access to feed in the first week and daily feed allocation based on pen BW from 2 WOA. Birds had free access to water throughout the trial. Body weight (BW) and uniformity (BW CV) were monitored. Boosters for infectious bronchitis and New Castle disease vaccines were administered at 18 WOA, and samples of pullets bled for antibody titer 5-day later. One pullet/pen was randomly selected, weighed, bled for plasma biochemistry, and necropsied for organ weights, ceca digesta for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and leg bones morphometry. In the starter and grower phases, birds fed HY were lighter and gained less (P < 0.05) than control birds. However, there were no diet effects (P > 0.05) on growth, the BW prelay phase, or BW uniformity throughout the trial. There were no (P > 0.05) diet effects on breast, gastrointestinal, liver and bursa weights, serum antibody titers, plasma biochemistry, SCFA and bone attributes. However, pullets fed HY had heavier (P = 0.047) spleen and tended to have lower (P = 0.080) plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) relative to control pullets. In conclusion, the parameters assessed showed no negative consequences of feeding HY to broiler breeder pullets. However, effects on the spleen and plasma AST may indicate modest modulation of immunity and metabolism. The impact of the provision of HY during broiler breeder pullet phase on reproductive performance and chick quality should be investigated.","Maina, A. N., Schulze, H. and Kiarie, E. G. (2024).

However, there is limited data on protein quality (PQ) of BSFLM. This study compared PQ in BSFLM with soybean meal (SBM) and fishmeal (FM) using the classical protein efficiency ratio (PER) chick growth assay model. A total of 240-male day-old Ross × Ross broiler chicks were allocated to 6 test diets for 10 d test. The corn starch-dextrose based diets were: 5 test diets containing 10% crude protein (CP) from casein (as a standard assay diet), SBM, FM, or BSFLM without or with (BSFLM+) additional essential amino acids (EAA) to match the levels of the SBM diet on digestible basis. A sixth diet was nitrogen-free (NFD), to enable calculation of net protein ratio (NPR). The birds had ad libitum access to feed and water, body weight (BW) and feed intake (FI) were recorded at the beginning and end of the experimental feeding period. Body weight gain (BWG), gain to feed ratio (G:F), crude protein intake (CPI), PER, and NPR were calculated. The analyzed CP (as fed) was 10.1, 12.8, 9.5, 11.7, and 14.9% for casein, SBM, FM, BSFLM, and BSFLM+ diets, respectively. Birds fed BSFLM+ had greater BWG (P < 0.01) than birds fed other diets. Feed intake was greater (P < 0.01) for birds fed BSFLM+ and FM diets than birds fed other diets. Birds fed BSFLM+ ate (P < 0.01) more CP than birds fed other diets. Diets had no (P > 0.05) effects on PER and NPR. In terms of ranking, the PER was 2.44, 2.38, 2.34, 2.28, and 2.10 g BWG/g CPI for BSFLM+, SBM, FM, casein, and BSLM, respectively. Corresponding values for NPR were 2.69, 2.78, 2.70, 2.74, and 2.48 g BWG/g CPI, respectively. In conclusion, the protein quality of BSFLM without or with additional EAA was comparable with FM and SBM.","Veronica Cheng, Anna Kate Shoveller, Lee-Anne Huber, and Elijah G. Kiarie. 2022.

The birds were selected from two groups reared on diets with or without 0.05 % HY from hatch. The birds were placed for the current study at 22 weeks of age (woa) in 16-floor pens (20 ♀ and 2 ♂/pen) based on rearing diet identity. Isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were formulated without or with 0.05 % HY for three production phases: 1 (22 to 40 woa), 2 (41 to 50 woa), and 3 (51 to 64 woa) and allocated within rearing diet identity in a completely randomized block design (n = 8). The birds had free access to water, whereas feed allocation was per breeder guidelines. Egg count/ pen was recorded four times daily from 25 woa (the time point the first egg was laid) to calculate hen day egg production (HDEP), and cumulative eggs per hen housed (CEPHH). From 28 woa, eggs were selected randomly for eggshell breaking strength (ESBS) and eggshell thickness (EST) and for incubation to determine fertility, hatchability, in-ovo mortality, chick sex ratio, and chick weight. Two hens per pen were necropsied at 44 and 64 woa for breast, abdominal fat and liver weights. There were no (P>0.05) interactions between diet and BB age or the diet effects on response criteria. Broiler breeder age effect (P<0.05) was such that HDEP, ESBS, EST, hatchability declined whereas egg weight, in-ovo mortality, and chick to egg weight ratio increased with age. Control birds had more (P=0.015) CEPHH (25 to 64 woa) than HY40 birds. In conclusion, the more CEPHH for the control group was reflective of hen mortality whereases the broiler breeder age effects were as expected.

"Market validation through customer-focused sensory analysis of functional bakery goods","2022-06-24","Sharma, Madhu; Duizer, Lisa","Department of Food Science. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.; Department of Food Science. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.","Agricultural Sciences; bread mix; muffin mix; consumer survey response","With growing market demand for healthy diet, more and more people are looking for easy-to use, healthy, and tasty bakery products. The pandemic had seen an increase in home baking with people desiring to bake their own bread and cakes. Sourdough is considered to be healthier and tastier than conventional bread due to long fermentation times. This bread must be made from scratch, requiring time and resources. A company has developed a ready-to-use dry multigrain sourdough bread mix using local ingredients that takes less time to prepare while still allowing consumers to have a home baking experience. A sugar-free cake mix was also formulated which could be used to make cakes, muffins, and cup cakes. This healthy high-fibre mix is a basic mix which has endless possibilities of making variations as per customers choice such as adding raspberry, blueberry, or chocolate. Market validation is needed to better understand the potential market demand and consumer requirements for the product attributes of these two products (e.g., flavor, texture, ingredient, price etc.). For the test, the mixes were home delivered to the interested participants. They had to bake the products, taste them and complete an online survey. The survey had questions on various aspects - demographics, product baking experience, taste and texture of product, liking, recommendation, consumption and purchase intent.",NA,"2021-09-01/2021-12-31","Ontario, Canada","Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs","100A_bakeryStudy_readme.txt; Data_BreadMix_BakeryRelatedDemographicQs.csv; Data_BreadMix_BreadBaking.csv; Data_BreadMix_BuyingQ.csv; Data_BreadMix_JustAboutRight.csv; Data_BreadMix_LikingQs.csv; Data_BreadMix_satisfactionRecommendConsume.csv; Data_BreadMix_SimilarityQs.csv; Data_BreadMix_totalParticipantsAgeGender.csv; Data_MuffinMix_BakeryRelated_DemographicQs.csv; Data_MuffinMix_BuyingQ.csv; Data_MuffinMix_JustAboutRight.csv; Data_MuffinMix_LikingQs.csv; Data_MuffinMix_MuffinBaking.csv; Data_MuffinMix_SatisfactionRecommendConsume.csv; Data_MuffinMix_SimilarityQs.csv; Data_MuffinMix_totalParticipantsAgeGender.csv","doi:10.5683/SP3/4RA3KT","Agri-environmental Research Data - Ontario Agricultural College - Department of Food Science"

Over a six-month study, the microbial ecosystems of milk, tap water and environmental swabs were cultured and sequenced to view the shared microbiota between the farm and the processing facility. Culture independent analysis of bacteria in milk, water and swab samples revealed a shared microbiota between the sample types of both facilities after sanitation. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that milk samples have a lower diversity than water or environmental swabs. Brevibacterium and Yaniella (both Actinobacteria) were observed in all sampling types. Further studies will include whole genome sequencing of Brevibacterium spp. isolates to determine their functionality and diversity within the system.","Wilson, Tara, Siddiqi, Myra, Xi, Yueqi, and LaPointe, Gisele. 2024.

As part of this program, registration and performance tests are conducted annually at various locations across the main bean growing areas in Ontario. This study provides the results of the 2012 Major Coloured Bean Registration Trial where several varieties of coloured beans were evaluated in multi-location yield-trials across Ontario. Coloured bean entries were planted in four replicated test plots at five locations across Ontario; Elora, Kippen, Monkton, St. Thomas, and Woodstock. Agronomic data including yield (adjusted to 18% moisture after combine harvest), days to maturity (number of days from planting to maturity), seed weight (estimated for 100 seeds), and seed quality were collected for each plot in each location.

The objective of the first survey was to identify preplant herbicide tankmixes that provide effective control of glyphosate-resistant Canada fleabane. Twelve field trials were conducted over a two year period (2011, 2012) at four farm locations in Essex County, Ontario to evaluate preplant herbicide tankmixes in glyphosate-resistant soybean for the control of Canada fleabane populations previously identified to be resistant to glyphosate. The first trial evaluated herbicides applied preplant with limited residual activity (Enhanced Burndown) while the second trial evaluated herbicides with residual activity for season long weed control (Burndown plus Residual). The objective of the second survey was to evaluate glyphosate and postemergence soybean herbicide efficacy on glyphosate-resistant Canada fleabane. Twelve field trials were conducted over a two year period (2011, 2012) at four farm locations in Essex County, Ontario. The first set of trials evaluated the level of glyphosate resistance in these populations (Biologically Effective Rate of Glyphosate) while the second set evaluated herbicides applied following soybean emergence (Postemergence Tankmixes).","Byker, Holly, P.

Genetic bases of flowering time and other agronomically important traits were examined in a set of interheterotic-pattern recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The RILs were developed from crossing the short-season Iodent inbred line CG60 with the short-season Stiff Stalk inbred line CG102. Recombinant inbred lines were derived through single-seed descent (S-RILs) or intermated for three generations before inbreeding (I-RILs), thereby increasing recombination. In this study the genetic means, covariances, and variances of flowering time (days to anthesis, DA, and days to silking, DS) and a number of flowering-time-associated traits, leaf number (LN), plant height (PH), and stay green (SG), in a set of short-season, interheterotic-pattern recombinant inbred lines (RILs) representing two levels of intermating were examined. The objectives were: (1) to evaluate the genetic basis of DA, DS, LN, PH, SG, and canopy reflectance traits within the short-season parental lines, (2) to evaluate genetic and phenotypic correlations between DA, DS, LN, PH, SG, and canopy refl ectance traits, and (3) to evaluate whether disruption of putative coupling and repulsion phase linkage blocks causes changes in population means, genetic variances, and genetic correlations.","Khanal, R., Earl, H., Lee, E.A. and Lukens, L.

Three 2 metre plots were staked out in each experimental unit in which measurements were made. All onions were seeded on 10 May. Germination counts were conducted on 30 May and 6 June to determine initial stands prior to the first generation assessment. Plants were examined for onion maggot or damage caused by other pests within the staked out sections on 21 June and 5 July. At this time damaged plants were removed and the cause recorded. Onion maggot damage was recorded two weeks after the first (30 June) and second generation (22 August) peaks and at onion bulb maturity (22 September).

The objective of the first survey was to determine effective control options for glyphosate resistant giant ragweed in soybean with herbicides applied preplant. Eighteen herbicide combinations were evaluated in field studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 at five locations with confirmed glyphosate resistant giant ragweed. The field sites were located near Windsor (L2 and L5), LaSalle (L1 and L4) and Amherstburg (L3), Essex County, Ontario. Two sets of experiments evaluating the effectiveness of glyphosate tankmixes with herbicides applied preplant were conducted. The first experiment (enhanced burndown) evaluated herbicides applied preplant (PP) that provided limited or no residual control. The second experiment (burndown plus residual) evaluated herbicides applied PP that provided burndown plus residual control. The second survey had two objectives; this first being to determine the efficacy of all the currently registered postemergence broadleaf herbicides registered for use in Ontario in soybean and the second objective was to determine the lowest effective rate of 2,4-D tank mixed with glyphosate and applied as a preplant burndown for control of glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed in soybean. Field studies were conducted in 2011 and 2012 at six locations for the postemergence broadleaf herbicide experiment and five locations for the 2,4-D dose response experiment with confirmed glyphosate resistant giant ragweed. The field sites were located near Windsor (L2 and L5), LaSalle (L1, L4 and L6) and Amherstburg (L3), Essex County, Ontario.

Peter; Torkamaneh, Davoud; Gomez, Marvin; Rosas, Juan Carlos","Department of Plant Agriculture. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.; Department of Plant Agriculture. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.; Department of Plant Agriculture. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.; Zamorano University. Honduras.; Zamorano University. Honduras.","Agricultural Sciences; Honduran bean germplasm; landrace; bean landraces; participatory plant breeding; nucleotide diversity; genetic differentiation; small red bean; black bean; common bean; Mesoamerican genepool; nitrogen fixation; carbon discrimination; days to flowering; days to maturity; yield; SNP marker; Phaseolus vulgaris","The study examined genetic diversity and agronomic, nitrogen-fixing, and water use efficiency traits among a panel of Honduran common beans (including landraces, varieties developed through participatory plant breeding, and conventional varieties bred for Central and North America). Genetic diversity: Genetic diversity was calculated in VCFtools software using the SNP data set (see accompanying repository file) to determine nucleotide diversity (π values) and genetic differentiation (FST values). The π statistic provides an indication of polymorphism within a population as measured by nucleotide diversity, and Tajima’s D (D) provides an indication of selection pressure. Both π and D were measured in sliding windows of 1 Mb across the genome using the --window-pi and --TajimaD options in VCFtools, which resulted in an average of 6 SNPs per window. The pairwise π and D values were also calculated among different subpopulations. Genome-wide averages of π and D for each breeding history category were generated by taking the average across all windowed calculations. Landrace and PPB π values were compared across the genome, and regions where landrace π exceeded PPB π by more than 3× were considered highly differentiated, and the regions that were at least 25,000 bp in length were considered significant. To investigate the level of differentiation between the landrace and PPB genotypes the FST statistic was computed. FST was calculated using the --weir-fst-pop option in VCFtools in sliding windows of 100 bp across the genome. Weighted FST values range from 0 with no genetic differentiation, to 1 where fixation of alleles has occurred. FST values exceeding 0.5 were considered significant in our analysis. Genotype descriptions: We examined trait diversity, significant differences between genotypes, and trait correlation for the panel overall, and by breeding history category. Agronomic traits (days to flowering, days to maturity, leaf chlorophyll content, hundred seed weight, yield) were measured in low-nitrogen field trials at the University of Guelph Elora research station (2014, 2015) and at Yorito, Honduras (2014-2015). These tables present a comprehensive description of the germplasm used in this study. Phenotype data: We examined trait diversity, significant differences between genotypes, and trait correlation for the panel overall, and by breeding history category. Agronomic traits (days to flowering, days to maturity, leaf chlorophyll content, hundred seed weight, yield) were measured in low-nitrogen field trials at the University of Guelph Elora research station (2014, 2015) and at Yorito, Honduras (2014-2015). Seed composition traits (nitrogen discrimination [δ15N], carbon discrimination [δ13C]) were measured using gas-chromatography-mass-spectometry at the Agriculture-Agrifood Canada facility in Lethbridge, Alberta. Percent nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) was calculated using normalized δ15N values with the formula described by Shearer and Kohl, 1988. SNPs: DNA was isolated from leaf tissue of young bean plants of each genotype grown in controlled-environment conditions at the University of Guelph. The NucleoSpin Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) or the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Canada) was used to extract DNA, following standard protocols. Genomic DNA was analyzed at the Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (McGill University, Montreal) for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChip (BARCBEAN6K_3) containing 5398 SNPs (Song et al., 2015).

The main objective of this research was to investigate the effects of low R/FR light on nitrogen assimilation in corn. To explore this, changes to the nitrogen assimilation pathway were measured in corn seedlings nine days post-emergence under low R/FR and control light conditions. The observed results indicate that nitrate levels increased and ferredoxin-dependent glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activities decreased under low R/FR light, however, no other pathway enzymes were affected. Changes in the pathway appear to be PhyB-independent, as Arabidopsis phyB mutant did not change the nitrate levels compared to wild-type Arabidopsis. The research indicates the importance of mitigating early-season weed competition and offers insight into the early physiological mechanisms involved in nitrogen utilization under resource-independent competition.This data was collected as part of William Kramer's MSc research work (see Related Publication).","Kramer, William. 2021.

Management is difficult due to the longevity of resting spores, the overwintering structure, in the soil. The efficacy of an experimental biofumigant was tested in both field and controlled environment studies. The field trial was conducted on high organic matter (muck) soil comparing 150 L/ha of biofumigant applied with a watering can to a control. In repeated controlled environment studies, 150 L/ha was applied to mineral and muck soils, in sealed plastic bags before transferring soil into pots. Soil samples were taken pre-and post-treatment application to determine the effect on resting spore number. All trials were seeded with clubroot susceptible canola and assessed for clubroot development six or seven weeks after seeding using a 0-3 scale to calculate disease severity index. In the field trial, there was no effect on clubroot severity. There was a decrease in resting spore concentrations, however it was not significant enough to decrease disease development. In the first repetition of the controlled environment study there was low severity and incidence in both soil types. The biofumigant caused a decrease in severity, however there was no interaction with soil type. In the repetition there was no clubroot development in mineral soil but high disease severity in muck soil. There was no effect of the biofumigant on disease severity. The experimental biofumigant may be more efficacious when there is lower disease pressure, however, more research is required.",NA,"2022-06-01/2022-09-30","Holland Marsh, Ontario, Canada","Canola Council of Canada; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture; SaskCanola; Ontario Canola Growers; Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance","ChesneyClubrootdrReadme.txt; EfficacyExpBiofumigant.pdf; FieldTrial.tab; GrowthRoomTrial1.tab; GrowthRoomTrial2.tab","doi:10.5683/SP3/YSOKO9","Agri-environmental Research Data - Ontario Agricultural College - Department of Plant Agriculture"

Simmons, is one of the most important diseases facing asparagus producers in Ontario. Four cultivars, Jersey Giant, Guelph Millennium, Guelph Eclipse, and Gijnlim were examined in the field and in detached-spear controlled environment assays for reaction to S. vesicarium infection. Consistent results were achieved in the controlled environment assays and cultivar, location on the spear, isolate, wounding, and lighting were each found to affect lesion formation. In the field, an interaction was identified between cultivar resistance and acute weather, especially heavy rainfall, before and during a critical infection period. In controlled environment studies there was an interaction between cultivar and location of inoculation on the spear, whether near the top or base. The bioassay was useful for assessing some mechanisms of resistance, but inoculating attached spears in the field, while accounting for weather, is recommended for determining realistic field results.","Austin, George, McDonald, Mary Ruth, Wolyn, David. 2023.

Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.; Department of Plant Agriculture. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.","Agricultural Sciences; fertility; forage; phosphorus","This dataset includes the supplemental data for the Masters thesis ""An improved understanding of phosphorus dynamics and fertility management in forage production systems"" and consists of forage fertility and pot trial data.Forage fertility trial: Soil fertility is vital for crop yields, but forage fertility often receives less attention compared to annual cash crops. In Ontario, producers typically apply 100 lbs acre-1 of 19-19-19 (N-P-K) fertilizer to forages, though its benefits are unclear. With new forage varieties like Festulolium, Ontario's recommendations have not changed since the 1980s. A three-year field trial aimed to determine the effect of fertility on the yield, quality, and profitability of 19 forage entries available on the Ontario market. The trial included three fertility treatments: 1) no fertilizer (control), 2) one-time spring application of 19-19-19 NPK, and 3) fertilization based on OMAFRA guidelines, alongside 19 different forage entries. The OMAFRA-recommended fertilization yielded the best results consistently, with yield differences between this and other treatments growing over time. By year 3, 100 lbs of 19-19-19 did not improve yields compared to no fertilizer. Grass-legume mixtures were more cost-effective and productive than pure grass mixtures. Red clover-based mixtures initially yielded more, but alfalfa-based mixtures were more productive overall. Mixtures outperformed single species for pure grasses. Lower tissue potassium (K) levels suggest K's critical role in yield, emphasizing the need for regular soil testing.Pot trial: Phosphorus (P) fertility recommendations for agricultural systems should be re-evaluated to increase P use efficiency. Current recommendations are based on soil test P (Olsen STP) concentrations indicating plant-available inorganic P but exclude organic P which can be made available over time through biological and biochemical mineralization of soil organic matter. This study explores whether P rates should be adjusted based on soil organic carbon (SOC) a key soil health indicator that is influenced by land use history. The aim was to understand the influence of SOC and other soil properties on crop response to added P using Lolium multiflorum in soils with varying SOC concentrations and contrasting land use histories (annual cropland or pasture). A 14-week growth room experiment investigated yield and P uptake using seven distinct field soils and five P application rates. Yield was positively correlated with soil P supply rate (using anion exchange probes) but not soil test P suggesting increased P supply from organic P mineralization in high SOC soils. This research highlights the importance of various soil health indicators including soil organic carbon and role of PSR in denoting plant-available P supply.","Lamichhane, Puja. 2024.

Abstract: Clubroot is an important disease limiting canola production in Canada. The current study examined the effects of selected soil amendments and inoculation timings on the development of clubroot. Lime consistently reduced clubroot severity when soil pH was raised above 7.0 but there was no interaction with boron. Boron reduced clubroot severity at relatively high rates. However, determining how boron suppresses clubroot was inconclusive. An experimental biofumigant was evaluated and was not effective against clubroot. Induced resistance / susceptibility was investigated using the reaction to avirulent / virulent pathotypes on split-root plants. Inoculation on one side of the split-root system did not induce a resistant or susceptible reaction on the other side when inoculated with the alternative pathotype. Based on the results of these studies, lime is the best option to include in a management system for clubroot in canola.","Chesney, S.G. 2024.

Pakistan.","Agricultural Sciences; Social Sciences; land endowment; rental markets; rural Pakistan","Ownership and access to land remains a long-standing issue of concern in Pakistan. The unequal land distribution is well documented. Although agriculture employs half of the country’s workforce, an estimated 60% of rural households are landless. In this setting rental markets play an important role in facilitating access to land. In this paper we empirically examine key factors that influence the amount of land rented in. Specifically, we explore the relationship between one’s endowment of land and the amount of land rented in. We perform our analysis using the Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey round 3.5 by conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in 2014-2015. The survey covers a wide range of topics including household characteristics, crop production, land management, farm assets, land inheritance and tenure security. Agricultural production activities are recorded for the Rabi season (2013-2014) and the Kharif season 2014. Of the 1027 household observations taken from the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces in Pakistan, the average household’s endowment of land is 3.4 acres. Our regression analysis indicates that households with larger endowments of land rent in less land. For an additional acre in land endowment, the amount rented in decreases by 0.32 acres. This number has economic significance given the high proportion of smallholdings and the prevalence of landlessness in Pakistan Hence, households with smaller initial endowments of farmland rely more heavily on the rental market to achieve scale in food production. Additionally, we provide evidence that factors like household size and asset ownership influence rental patterns. On average, an additional household member would increase the amount rented in by 0.12 acres. Tractor ownership also has a positive effect on the amount of land rented in. However, our regression estimates suggest that transactions are present in the farmland market thus preventing renters from reaching their optimal farm size. These results are relevant to ongoing efforts to support and enhance agricultural productivity in the region.","Tia, A.E., Deaton, B.J., Hailu, G., & Nazli, H. (2022).

The survey gathered responses from 999 Canadian recreational anglers using a double-bounded dichotomous-choice format. In comparison to a baseline that quantitatively elicits anglers’ WTP for the use of eDNA toolkits, this study also estimates how additional information regarding genomic technologies influences WTP. Results indicate that the provision of additional information has no significant effect on respondents’ WTP. On average, Canadian recreational anglers are willing to pay premiums between 7%-23% of their reported annual fishing expenditure to fish on otherwise-identical watersheds adopting novel eDNA toolkits. Findings from this study can be used to inform fisheries management policies, and evidence suggests Canadian recreational anglers have strong preferences for the adoption of eDNA technology regardless of the information they are exposed to. ","Li, Tongzhe and Smith, Conor, Canadian Recreational Anglers’ Preferences to Fish on Watersheds Adopting Novel Genomic Technologies.

It includes 419 communities: 118 First Nations communities and 301 municipalities. It identifies communities that were supplied in whole or in part through water sharing arrangements (WSAs) during the study period. And it includes a number of key community characteristics: northerness, elevation, population density, remoteness, and regional wealth. This data set was gathered for the purpose of exploring factors influencing local communities in Ontario - First Nations and municipalities - to participate in WSAs. Specifically, in our paper we explore whether First Nations communities – many of which suffer persistently poor drinking water conditions – are less likely to be engaged in WSAs than municipalities. Our findings suggest that while First Nations have a lower rate of WSA particpation compared to municipalities, the likelihood of WSA participation is more strongly influenced by key community characteristics like geography, remoteness and regional wealth.

Many First Nations and municipalities across Ontario have formed collaborative relationships to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, such as improved service provision, or economic development. The aim of this research project was the study of collaborative water sharing arrangements between First Nations and municipalities in Ontario. This $371,300 project took place between 2018-2025. It was an interdisciplinary effort, involving a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods including statistical analysis, and in-depth case studies. It involved the efforts of several Undergraduate and Graduate Research Assistants, in addition to the research team identified below. The central aim was to identify the potential scope for water sharing in the Province, and factors influencing communities to engage, or not engage, in these exchanges. The empirical portion of the research that produced this data was led by Brady Deaton, with data organization and archiving efforts led by Bethany Lipka. The Canadian Tri-Agency Statement of Principles on Digital Data Management states that “research data collected with the use of public funds belong, to the fullest extent possible, in the public domain and available for reuse by others”. The research team has striven to meet this open data standard, by making all empirical project data available to future users in a well-documented and accessible manner.

Using data characterizing drinking water systems and their host communities in the Canadian province of Ontario, we assess the following question: Do WSAs influence drinking water quality outcomes for recipient water systems? We find that WSAs are associated with improved drinking water quality outcomes for First Nation recipient systems. We do not associate WSAs with improved outcomes for municipal recipient systems. These differing effects may be due to provincial state capacity which is available to all municipalities, irrespective of WSA status, and the subset of First Nation systems in a WSA.","Deaton, B.

Over 5000 data points were extracted from 270 papers published between 1979 and 2009. These metadata were extracted from an exhaustive review and collection of relevant literature and attempted to synthesize and examine generalizations about herbivore response to CO2 across the literature. This study addressed the responses of insect herbivores to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) across numerous insect orders and feeding guilds. The changes in 19 animal response variables to the main effect of elevated CO2 was examined. The study also addressed underlying plant mechanisms by quantifying those plant growth and metabolite responses most relevant to insect herbivory and examined how such responses were altered by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Examined were the main effects of elevated CO2 on: six plant growth and allocation responses, seven primary metabolite responses, eight secondary metabolite responses, and four physical defense responses. These response variable changes were examined under two-way and three-way interactions between CO2 and: soil nitrogen, ambient temperature, drought, light availability, photosynthetic pathway, reproductive system, plant growth rate, plant growth form, tissue type, and nitrogen fixation.","Robinson E.A.,Ryan G.D.and Newman J.A.(2012).

First identified in Pennsylvania in 2001, it has now been detected in 44 states and 3 provinces (Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia), and is of economic importance throughout the Mid-Atlantic US. There are more than 170 North American plant hosts, including broad spectrum of important fruit (e.g., apples and grapes), vegetable and field crops, as well as landscape trees and shrubs. All are important agricultural commodities in Ontario. The presence of increasing numbers of BMSB in close proximity to high risk agricultural crops continues to heighten grower concerns. Effective and novel management strategies need to be identified and surveys continued.The primary goal of this project was to identify sustainable management strategies for BMSB in crops immediately at risk in Ontario (i.e., apples, tender fruits and grapes) and continue to survey for presence of the invasive pest in at risk crops with grower cooperation. Objectives: 1) Investigate sustainable management strategies for BMSB including: i) Chemical control (oral and contact toxicity, methods of delivering products insecticides (singly and in combinations), attract and kill combinations, and ii) Genetic control - RNAi tactics; 2) Development of diagnostic methods in fruits (apples, tender fruits and grapes) to improve our ability to identify BMSB damage in the field (differentiate from indigenous stink bug damage). 3) Continue to survey for BMSB in at risk crops focusing on a program that involves growers being responsible for operation of pheromone traps on their orchards/farms.",NA,"2016-10/2021-03","Ontario, Canada, Southern Ontario","Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance","100A_biocontrolCM_dataDescription_20210624.pdf; biocontrol_preservationCSVs.zip; biocontrolCM_choiceTest20210624_Bcalva.tab; biocontrolCM_choiceTest20210624_Chilaris.tab; biocontrolCM_choiceTest20210624_Etristigmus.tab; biocontrolCM_choiceTest20210624_Evariolarius.tab; biocontrolCM_choiceTest20210624_Pmaculiventris.tab; biocontrolCM_choiceTest20210624_Tcaccerra.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_CHOCC.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_Fruith.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_HFB.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_Killarney.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_LORDC.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_Ravine.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_SLP.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_Southb.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_VMF.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2019to21_Wildfound.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2020to21_CentralAve.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2020to21_GainsboroughMeadows.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2020to21_Killarney.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2020to21_Southbranch.tab; biocontrolCM_fieldTrials2020to21_Wildlaid.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Atristis.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Bcalva.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Bdimidiata.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Bsordida.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Cbimaculata.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Chilaris.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Etristigmus.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Evariolarius.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Pmaculiventris.tab; biocontrolCM_noChoiceTests2021_Tcaccerra.tab; diagnostic_preservationCSVs.zip; 100A_diagnostic_2018_dataDescription.pdf; diagnostic_2018_applesAD_H.tab; diagnostic_2018_applesAD_LS.tab; diagnostic_2018_applesAD_NY_Lab.tab; diagnostic_2018_applesNY_H.tab; diagnostic_2018_applesNY_LS.tab; diagnostic_2018_hazelnutsAD_H.tab; diagnostic_2018_hazelnutsAD_LS.tab; diagnostic_2018_hazelnutsAD_NY_Lab.tab; diagnostic_2018_hazelnutsNY_H.tab; diagnostic_2018_hazelnutsNY_LS.tab; 100A_diagnostic_2019_hazelnutProjectUpdate.pdf; diagnostic_2019_hazelnut.xlsx; diagnostic_2019_peach.xlsx; checkingPipeTrapStratusWinery.jpg; liveBMSBAdultInPipeTrapSunnydale.jpg; liveBMSBAdultNaturalHostNearbyPipeTrapRavineWinery.jpg; PheroconBMSBDualLureTreceBblackFerconVapourtapeRedInsecticidalStrips.jpg; PheroconBMSBDualLureTreceConsistsTwoUnitsUsedTogether.jpg; pipeTrapSetupBorderWoodlotMountainviewOrchards.jpg; pipeTrapSetupBorderWoodlotMoyerFarms.jpg; pipeTrapSetupNaturalHostFiverowsWinery.jpg; pipeTrapSetupNaturalHostRavineWinery.jpg; pipeTrapSetupPearOrchardSunnydale.jpg; pipeTrapSetupStratusWinery.jpg; stickyTrapSetupBorderWoodlotFruithavenFarm.jpg; stickyTrapSetupGrapesTregunnoFarms.jpg; stickyTrapSetupWoodlotGreenlaneFarms.jpg; insecticidesAG_20180501_directContact.tab; insecticidesAG_20180501_residualContact.tab; insecticidesAG_preservationCSVs.zip; 100A_phenology_metadata.tab; phenology_preservationsCSVs.zip; phenology_rawData.tab; UG2017-2907SurveyData2018.csv; UG2017-2907SurveyData2019.csv; UG2017-2907SurveyLocations2018.txt; UG2017-2907SurveyLocations2019.txt","doi:10.5683/SP2/HMV5RF","Agri-environmental Research Data - Ontario Agricultural College - School of Environmental Sciences"

An editable interactive table was created using Microsoft Excel that would allow individuals to determine how pesticide treatment in their selected jurisdiction (province in Canada or state in the United States) and crop translates into habitat saved, calories produced, and mouths fed. This table allows the user to choose the country (Canada or United States), whether to include the organic agriculture correction factor, their state or province of interest, crop, and whether a young child, adolescent child, adult women, or adult man is being fed. The table will then calculate the hectares of habitat saved, added number of calories produced (kcal), the number of individual fed in one day, and the number of individual fed in one year.

Despite the importance of studying early life stages, very few standard protocols for benthic invertebrates commonly used in ecotoxicological assessments measure developmental endpoints. The goal of the present study was to develop and optimize a robust standard protocol for studying embryonic endpoints in freshwater gastropods. The developed method was then used to characterize the sensitivity of numerous embryonic endpoints (viability, hatching, deformities, and biomass production), in conjunction with juvenile and adult mortality, for the snail Planorbella pilsbryi exposed to a suite of metals (Cu, Cd, & Ni). Biomass production was typically the most sensitive endpoint but was relatively variable while embryo hatching was slightly less sensitive but highly consistent for all three metals. However, no single embryonic endpoint was consistently the most sensitive which demonstrates the importance of assessing a broad range of endpoints, life stages, and organisms in ecotoxicological risk assessment. Interestingly, the embryonic life stage of P. pilsbryi was considerably less sensitive to Cu exposure compared with juvenile and adult mortality. However, for Cd exposure, embryonic endpoints were the most sensitive and for Ni exposure were similarly sensitive to juvenile and adult mortality. This study has valuable applications in conducting developmental toxicity research with organisms lacking standardized testing protocol as well as future applications in multi-generational and in silico toxicity research.","Osborne, R.K., Ijzerman, M.M., Venier, C. and Prosser, R.S.

The pepper weevil (PW), Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an economically significant pest of Capsicum crops in North America for which current management strategies are often insufficient. As a PW-SIT program has yet to be considered, this foundational research determined that a gamma radiation dose of 110 Gy applied to PW pupae was necessary to induce > 99% sterility in females, and > 97% sterility in males, though the longevity, spontaneous flight activity, sperm production, and mating competitiveness of the sterile adults were negatively impacted by the treatment. Based on this work, a PW-SIT program could effectively and sustainably manage total PW populations in field or greenhouse pepper crops, and further research is recommended to ensure its success.","Basso, Jacob. 2022.

However, there are challenges associated with using reproduction as an endpoint in current standard methods, including: confounding effects of growth on reproduction, high biological variability associated with reproduction, and difficult recovery of juveniles from sediment. A novel, 28-d toxicity test method was created to optimize the reproduction endpoints by initiating tests with sexually mature amphipods to eliminate the confounding effects of growth, using a sex ratio of 2.3 females per male to reduce reproductive variability, and conducting tests in water-only conditions to improve juvenile recovery. The novel method was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity and reliability of reproduction data to standard methods. Reproduction endpoints produced similar results between methods, but the data were less variable in novel tests. The novel method shows promise to improve the use of reproduction as an endpoint in water-only toxicity tests with H. azteca.","Khan, H.N., Bartlett, A.J., Kudla, Y., and Prosser, R.S. 2023.

"An assessment of the toxicity of pesticide mixtures in periphyton from agricultural streams to the mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer","2023-04-13","Prosser, Ryan","School of Environmental Sciences. Ontario Agricultural College. University of Guelph.","Earth and Environmental Sciences; riverine environments; pesticides; periphyton; Neocloeon triangulife","Ontario’s streams are susceptible to pesticide pollutants which are transported outside of the intended area of application from surrounding agricultural fields. Periphyton are a vital dietary component for grazing organisms in aquatic ecosystems but can also accumulate substantial levels of pesticides from the surrounding water. Consequently, grazing aquatic organisms are likely subjected to pesticide exposure through the consumption of pesticide contaminated periphyton. The objectives of this study were to determine if pesticides partition into periphyton in riverine environments across Southern Ontario, and if so, to determine the toxicity of pesticides in periphyton when fed to the grazing mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer. Ten sites across Southern Ontario were sampled between May-September 2021. Sites with low, medium, and high pesticide exposure based on historic water quality monitoring data were selected to incorporate a pesticide exposure gradient into the study design. Artificial substrate samplers were utilized to colonize periphyton in situ, which was then analyzed for the presence of ~500 pesticides. Results from this study demonstrate that periphyton is capable of accumulating pesticides in agricultural streams. A novel, 7-day toxicity test method was created to investigate the effects of pesticides partitioned into periphyton when fed to N. triangulifer. Periphyton collected from the field sites were fed to N. triangulifer and survival and biomass production were recorded. Survival and biomass production significantly decreased when fed periphyton colonized in streams with catchments dominated by agricultural land use (p<0.05). However, the relationship observed between pesticide concentration and survival or biomass production was not consistent. Using field colonized periphyton allowed us to assess dietary toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticide mixtures, however nutrition and taxonomic composition of the periphyton may vary between sites. We recommend future research to simulate individual pesticide exposures to periphyton in the laboratory prior to performing these novel dietary toxicity assessments.","Ijzerman MM, Raby M, Izma GB, Kudla YM, Letwin NV, Gallant MJ, Schiffer SR, Atkinson BJ, Rooney RC, Sibley PK, Prosser RS.

A total of 66 representative trees from five above species were selected, harvested and their aboveground biomass and C content were quantified. Three commonly used allometric models were used to develop predictive equations. Regression models were developed and parameterized for each tree species and the best are presented based on information criteria (AIC, AICc, and BIC), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), over/under estimation (MOUE), root mean square error (RMSE), R2, and regression coefficients (a, b) of the observed/predicted (OP) linear regression analysis.","Bazrgar, A.B., Thevathasan, N., Gordon, A. et al.

The data in this collection aims to quantify SOC sequestration rates using 2016 baseline data, assess soil total nitrogen and phosphorus in different land-use systems, measure SOC and nitrogen in various soil aggregate-size fractions, evaluate greenhouse gas emissions influenced by applied fertilizer treatments, determine carbon dioxide (CO2) released from different fractions through incubation studies, and analyze SOC stability and sustainability across three land-use systems. Additionally, the dataset aims to quantitatively assess biomass yields influenced by different biofertilizers provided by industry partners, ranking them based on their yield response and cost-effectiveness. The dataset also contributes to the development of soil health indicators for biomass crops by quantitatively assessing fungal communities (micro-faunal), earthworm densities (macro-faunal), SOC, Haney soil health, and Solvita test.","Sowthini Vijayakumar, Sarah Hasenack, Amir Behzad Bazrgar, Holly Patricia Ivany, Kari E.

However, the effects of PV panels on near-surface air temperature are less conclusive. This study presents an upgraded physics-based rooftop PV numerical model UCRC-Solar and its implementation in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), a widely used numerical weather prediction model. A full-year measurement campaign at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, was conducted to capture the surface-atmosphere exchange for a rooftop array of tilted PV panels. The upgraded UCRC-Solar was evaluated extensively both offline with the observed data and online in WRF against the newly collected PV module surface temperature and electricity production. Finally, WRF experiments with different PV configurations on flat roofs were explored in Toronto, Ontario, to study their impacts on the local climate.","Yin, Hang; Krayenhoff, E.

Elora Research Station/Guelph Turfgrass Institute",NA,"Earth and Environmental Sciences; Meteorology; air temperature; longwave radiation; precipitation; pressure; relative humidity; soil temperature; solar radiation; snowfall; sunshine; water table; wind direction; wind speed","The University of Guelph, School of Environmental Sciences, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology Group, in cooperation with Environment Canada, maintains an automatic weather station at the Elora Research Station located a few kilometres south of Elora, Ontario. This station collects hourly climatic data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and speed at 2m and 10m above ground, solar radiation, longwave radiation, precipitation, snow on ground, snowfall, amount of sunshine, and soil temperature. This data set includes climatic data collected from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012, and is presented as monthly data files broken down into five categories: hourly data, 0800 (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 1700 yesterday to 0800 today except soil temperatures which are measured at 0800), 1700 (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 0800 today to 1700 today except soil temperatures which are measured at 1700), 24 hour (data for 24 hour period from 0100 hours), and precipitation (at every minute of occurrence) data. Annual files are also provided for hourly, 0800, 1700, and 24 hour data.",NA,"2008-01-01/2012-12-31","Elora, Ontario, Canada",NA,"Elora_Weather_Station_Refurbished_Descriptions.pdf; ERS_24_hour_period_from_0100_2008.tab;

Elora Research Station/Guelph Turfgrass Institute",NA,"Earth and Environmental Sciences; Meteorology; air temperature; net radiation; precipitation; relative humidity; soil temperature; solar radiation; water table; wind direction; wind speed","The University of Guelph, School of Environmental Sciences, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology Group, in cooperation with Environment Canada, maintains an automatic weather station at the Elora Research Station located a few kilometres south of Elora, Ontario. This station collects hourly climatic data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and speed, solar radiation, net radiation, precipitation, and soil temperature. This data set includes climatic data collected from 1999 to September 30, 2003, and is presented as monthly data files broken down into four categories: hourly data, 0800 (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 1600 yesterday to 0800 today), 1600 (maximum/minimum values for data collected from 0800 today to 1600 today), and precipitation (at every minute of occurrence) data. Annual files are also available for hourly, 0800, and 1600 data. Supplement data collected by hand, including temperature, humidity and precipitation data, organized by year is also included. The weather station was fitted with an updated suite of instruments during August 2003 therefore a new set of meteorological parameters are being collected starting in September 2003. Data collected using the old system are included for September 2003 however some data was lost during the system conversion. The data for September 2003 to December 2003 collected using the new system are included in the study Weather Records for the Elora Research Station, Elora, Ontario [Canada]: Meteorological data 2003 to 2007.",NA,"1999-01-01/2003-09-30","Elora, Ontario, Canada",NA,"ERS_hour_0800_data_1999.tab;

The objective of this study were (1) to evaluate the magnitude of nitrous oxide emissions reduction due to best management practices in comparison to conventional management practices and (2) to study the seasonal variability in reduction of emissions due to the interaction between management and weather. This dataset is part of a long-term assessment measuring nitrous oxide emissions over a five year period (2000-2005). The data was collected within four experimental plots located at the Elora Research Station in Southern Ontario, Canada. Experimental plots consisted of two management systems: conventional practice (plots 1 and 4) and best management practice (plots 2 and 3). Data collected consists of meteorological data including vector data, crop height, crop yield measurements, plant matter and soil mineral nitrogen accumulations, nitrous oxide flux, soil bulk density, soil moisture content, soil temperature, as well as auxillary data including plot description/history information and instrument placement (i.e. placement and height). This study includes only the soil data collected between 2000 and 2005 and consists of original measurements and analyzed data for bulk density calculations, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen measurements, mass spectrometry data, and soil nitrogen measurements.","Furon, A.C., C.

The Right Product consisted of either an urea-based enhanced efficiency fertilizer (EEF, urea with nitrification and urease inhibitor) or an urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN)-based EEF (UAN with nitrification and urease inhibitor). The Right Time consisted in delaying application until the 6-8th leaf stage (application as side-dress).

The projects were conducted on two newly established putting greens. Project A) was conducted on a putting green constructed from calcareous USGA sand at the new Guelph Turfgrass Institute site. Project B) was completed on a putting green constructed from siliceous sand conforming to the United States Golf Association (USGA) construction method. 2019 results provide a preliminary look at the function/efficacy of soil surfactants, with the goal of examining their long-term effects on rootzone and turfgrass properties over subsequent seasons.

Also, to investigate whether hens' pecking behavior follows a diurnal pattern that aligns with their calcium appetite. Additionally, the study evaluates how the consumption of PS influences eggshell quality, measuring factors such as eggshell breaking strength and thickness. By using a controlled experimental design involving two phases of treatment, the experiment analyzes changes in PS consumption and pecking behavior over time.

Finally, two methods for estimating DON content in grain samples were compared, to determine the correlation between the estimates. We hypothesize that there will be a strong relationship between resistance components and DON content in the grain estimated using either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or fast-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (FC-MS/MS) methods.

Six databases were searched for relevant primary research. Eligible studies must have examined umbilical health in an intensively raised bovine population. There were 4,250 articles that fit within the search terms and had their title and abstracts screened by two independent reviewers for potential relevance. From these, 724 full text articles were then screened, with 150 articles meeting the review criteria for data extraction. Seventeen were classified as descriptive, 24 were clinical trials, and 109 were analytical observational studies. Umbilical outcomes evaluated in descriptive studies were omphalitis (n = 11), parasitic infections of the umbilicus (n = 5), and umbilical hernias (n = 2). Only one clinical trial (n = 1) examined treatment of navel infections, whereas the remainder evaluated management factors that could be used to prevent a navel health outcome (n = 23), which included umbilical infections (n = 17), navel myasis (n = 3), navel measurements (n = 5), umbilical hernias (n = 1), and umbilical edema (n = 1). Analytical observational studies included studies examining risk factors for umbilical health (n = 60) and studies examining umbilical health itself as a risk factor (n = 60). Studies examining risk factors for umbilical health classified their outcomes as umbilical infections (n= 28), 11 of which were undefined and one which defined as diagnosed by a veterinarian. Umbilical hernias (n=8), two of which were only defined as diagnosed by a veterinarian and one which diagnosed by the herd manager. The remaining umbilical outcomes included scoring the navel sheath/flap size (n = 16), navel myasis (n = 2), and measurements of the umbilicus (n = 6). Studies examining umbilical health as a risk factor defined the umbilical risk factors as umbilical infection (n=39) of which 13 were undefined, umbilical hernias (n=8) of which 4 were undefined (several articles examined both umbilical infections and hernias), navel dipping (n = 12), navel/sheath scores as part of conformation classification for breeding (n = 2), navel measurements (n = 3), and umbilical cord drying times (n = 2). This review highlights the areas in need of future umbilical health research such as clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different treatments of umbilical infection. It also emphasizes the importance of future studies to clearly define umbilical health outcomes of interest.Data description:This supplementary document presents data aimed at describing and characterizing the existing literature regarding umbilical health in bovines.

However, due to our limited understanding of how the existing network instrumentation responds to changes in near surface soil F/T, these networks are largely ignored during the winter months. This case study describes the results of a small plot-scale (7 x7 m) study from November 2013 through April 2014 instrumented with 36 Hydra Probes. During the study, soil temperature and real dielectric permittivity were measured every 15 minutes during two F/T transition periods at shallow soil depths (0-10 cm). Categorical soil temperature and real dielectric permittivity techniques were then used to define the soil F/T state during these periods. The study showed that both methods for detecting soil freezing showed agreement (53.3- 60.9 %) during the spring thaw. Bootstrapping results demonstrated that both moderate to strong agreement with each other (84.7- 95.6 %) during the fall freeze but only weak techniques showed a mean difference within ±1.0°C and ±1.4 between the standard 5 cm below ground horizontal probe installation depth and the 2, 10 and integrated 0 -5.7 cm probe depths installed within the same study plot. Overall this study demonstrates that the Hydra Probe offers promise for near surface soil F/T detection using existing soil moisture monitoring networks. The research also suggests that the device may have important applications for the validation of remote sensing F/T products.","Williamson, Matthew, Justin R. Adams, Aaron A.

This method has been shown to be effective in lower latitude environments however there has been a lack of investigation in arctic environments, particularly in organic permafrost soils. A preliminary analysis was performed at Trail Valley Creek, Northwest Territories, where an investigation of the statistical spatial variability of soil moisture and processes controlling soil moisture was completed. Both of these are key steps required for modeling soil moisture retrievals from satellites. Second, an assessment of the sensitivity of RADARSAT-2 backscatter to surface soil moisture conditions was completed to examine whether SAR can provide a much needed method to map soil moisture across the arctic. Results showed a strong relationship between backscatter and soil moisture (R2 =0.688) and demonstrate the potential for SAR soil moisture retrieval in arctic ecosystems.","Humphrey, Rachel. 2015.

In this study, we derive records of tree growth and establishment from nine alpine treeline ecotones in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, characterise the influence of seasonal climate variables on four tree species (Abies lasiocarpa, Larix lyallii, Picea engelmannii, Pinus albicaulis) and estimate the degree to which treeline movement in the twentieth century has lagged or exceeded the rate predicted by recent temperature warming. The growth and establishment records revealed a widespread increase in radial growth, establishment frequency and stand density beginning in the mid-twentieth century. Coinciding with a period of warming summer temperatures and favourable moisture availability, these changes appear to have supported upslope treeline advance at all sites (range, 0.23–2.00 m/year; mean, 0.83 + 0.67 m/ year). However, relationships with seasonal climate variables varied between species, and the rates of treeline movement lagged those of temperature warming in most cases. These results indicate that future climate change impacts on treelines in the region are likely to be moderated by species composition and to occur more slowly than anticipated based on temperature warming alone.","Davis, E.L., Brown, R., Daniels, L. et al.

To test this, we determined the relative interaction intensity of biomass allocation for natives grown alone vs. those grown in native-invasive species pairs and measured photosynthetic traits that contribute to plant invasiveness and may be affected by elevated CO2 concentrations. We found no effect of CO2 for plant production measures of interaction intensity or for relative performance for most of the measured photosynthetic traits. In competition, invaders nearly always produced more biomass and tillers than natives, regardless of CO2 level. The results suggest that increasing CO2 concentration alone has little effect on grass competitive outcomes under controlled conditions.","Hager, H.A., Ryan, G.D., and Newman, J.A. 2020.

For Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, an emerging hypothesis is that the change could be triggered by shifts in competitive dominance among plant functional groups, specifically from the dominant decay-resistant Sphagnum to the more decomposable vascular plants. However, the relationship between Sphagnum and vascular plant occurrence is notably complex and also includes facilitative interactions that are crucial to the productivity of Sphagnum and therefore carbon sequestration. We use a conceptual review to examine underlying mechanisms for the competitive exclusion hypothesis and the nature of facilitative interactions between Sphagnum and vascular plants under the potential global change conditions. We supported the review with a field study conducted at Luther Marsh conservation area where we quantified, hummock dimensions, light penetration , C:N, hummock moisture profile etc between two hydrologically contrasting sites.","T.A.

The current repository contains metabarcoding and associated data for a 407-nucleotide segment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) animal barcode region. Fluid was collected from 12 Lindgren funnel traps in two Ontario regions in forested areas to survey for wood boring beetles of regulatory concern.

Such endophytes may increase host invasiveness in the non-native, introduced ranges. However, the costs and benefits for the host can vary with the abiotic and biotic growing conditions, and the endophyte may become locally or temporally extinct when costs outweigh benefits. Our long-term field experiment involved seven Schedonorus pratensis (meadow fescue) cultivars hosting Epichloë uncinata endophyte, which represent host-grass populations with different genetic background and Epichloë infection levels. In the first six years, the host grasses persisted but did not become invasive in an old-field plant community, regardless of their endophyte infection frequency. We hypothesized that increasing nutrient availability would decrease endophyte costs and thus increase the host’s success and abundance. We fertilized half of the plots for four additional years and re-examined S. pratensis invasiveness. We predicted that increased nutrient availability would increase S. pratensis abundance and E. uncinata frequency and concentration, as well as decrease plant community diversity, relative to unfertilized plots. Fertilization increased endophyte concentrations in three host populations with low endophyte infection frequency.

Early observations suggested that Epichloë may have negative allelopathic effects on neighbouring plant species, particularly Trifolium spp. clovers, but subsequent allelopathy tests produced variable results. We examined two hypotheses: (1) Epichloë allelopathy negatively affects other plant species, and (2) Epichloë strains differ in their allelopathic effect. We performed a greenhouse experiment using root exudates from Lolium perenne hosting different E. festucae var. lolii strains to compare their allelopathic effects on native legumes and forbs. We then used meta-analysis to examine the evidence to date for allelopathic effects of Epichloë endophytes. We found very little evidence for negative allelopathic effects of Epichloë in cool-season grasses across a range of methodologies, test plant species, and response measures, and there was little difference among E. festucae var. lolii strains. Negative allelopathic effects were detected only for root hair measures, which were from a single study. Positive effects on biomass were found for some experimental subgroups, including legumes. However, the majority of response variables showed no evidence for Epichloë allelopathy. Although there is currently little evidence for negative Epichloë allelopathic effects, our meta-analysis identified several research gaps. Experiments testing the functional belowground effects of Epichloë presence may help to determine its effects on non-host plant performance via plant-soil feedbacks.","Hager, H.A., Gailis, M. & Newman, J.A.

At present, the Research Ethics Board at U of G does not recognize Manomin as a spirit being like the Anishinabeg do.
