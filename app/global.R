# Initialize an empty list to store modules, tabs and functions
explorer_list <- list()

# List all R script files from the "App_modules" and "App_function" directories
my_helpers <- list.files(
  c("appFunction", "appTabs"), # Directories to search in
  recursive = TRUE,   # Search within sub-directories
  full.names = TRUE,  # Return full file paths instead of just file names
  pattern = "\\.R$"   # Match only files ending with ".R"
)

# Loop through the list of R script files and source them (execute their contents)
for (f in my_helpers) {
  source(f)  # Load the script into the current R session, allowing functions and variables to be used
}
