### 1.0 Background

RED-X is a web-based application built with R Shiny and hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io). It is designed to help researchers explore historical research data. RED-X connects to the [Borealis Dataverse](https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/ugardr) via Application Programming Interface (API). The retrieved data/information is stored in an embedded relational database to store and retrieve data efficiently. It updates automatically every 48 hours to provide an up-to-date metadata and research data.

### 2.0 Accessing RED-X

You can access the app directly through the following link:
ðŸ”— **[Launch RED-X](https://agrifooddatacanada.shinyapps.io/RED-X/)**  

> **Note** : No installation or login is required. RED-X is optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile functionality is limited.

### 3.0 System Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Stable internet connection.
- Recommended screen resolution: 1280Ã—720 or higher.

### 4.0 Overview of the Interface

When you launch RED-X, youâ€™ll land on the **Home** tab, which provides an at-a-glance overview of the database contents. The layout includes a **carousel-style summary** displaying summary statistics like:


- Connected dataverses
- Total number of studies
- Number of authors
- Available keywords
- Number of downloadable files

It also introduces users to the two primary interactive tools like:

####  4.1 Network Explorer 

This tab allows you to explore **relationships between keywords, authors, departments, and colleges** using an interactive network graph. Itâ€™s designed to support discovery, literature and data review, and collaboration tracking.

#### 4.2 Data Explorer

This section allows users to **browse and filter studies**, view their metadata, raw data, summary statistic and visualize data. Filters are available by college, campus and institution.

### 5.0 Data Refresh Cycle

RED-X connects to the **Borealis Dataverse** using an API calls. Metadata and datasets are updated every 48 hours to ensure access to the most recent content available from contributing institutions.
