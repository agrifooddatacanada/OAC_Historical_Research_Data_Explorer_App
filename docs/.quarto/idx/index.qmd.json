It simplifies access to metadata, visualizes keyword/author relationships, and supports informed reuse of datasets. With version 2.0, RED‑X delivers faster performance, a broader institutional scope, and intuitive visual tools.\n\n---\n\n### 2.0 Background and Motivation\n\nRED-X was developed in response to a growing need for **efficient access to historical research datasets**—particularly in the agricultural and environmental sciences. \n\nOver the years, large volumes of valuable data have been collected by researchers at the **University of Guelph**, especially through the **Ontario Agricultural College (OAC)**. However, much of this data remained siloed, inconsistently described, or difficult to navigate, making reuse a significant challenge.\n\nThe motivation behind RED-X came from a **workshop hosted by the University of Guelph in collaboration with Compute Ontario**, which focused on enhancing the **FAIRness** (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research data. Researchers, librarians, and data specialists at the event emphasized the need for a user-friendly tool that could help bridge the gap between stored data and actionable insight.\n\nRED-X was thus envisioned as a **web-based metadata and dataset discovery platform**, built using **RShiny**, that connects directly to **Borealis**, a Dataverse-based data repository platform. The app provides both technical and non-technical users with intuitive tools for exploring, visualizing, and filtering datasets, enabling better use of existing research outputs and supporting data-driven collaboration across departments and institutions.\n\n---\n\n### 3.0 Purpose & Goals\n\n- **Unlock historical research insights** — aggregates metadata and datasets from multiple colleges and departments within the Agri-environmental Research Data dataverse in Borealis (Canadian Dataverse Repository).\n- **Promote FAIR principles** — ensures data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, elevating the value of Agri-Food data.\n- **Enhance discoverability** — presents keyword-author network visualizations and smart filters to reveal connections and trends.\n\n---\n\n### 4.0 Who Should Use RED‑X\n\n- **Academic researchers/Scientist** investigating historical trends.  \n- **Data librarians and stewards** aiming to manage and share historical datasets.  \n- **Graduate students** conducting meta-analyses or literature reviews/data review.\n\n---\n\n### 5.0 Key Features in Version 2.0\n\n- **Optimized loading** through direct database access and 48‑hour auto-refresh.  \n- **Network Explorer** — visualize relationships among keywords, authors, institutions, and colleges.\n- **Explore datasets and metadata**- Navigate historical datasets collected across various colleges and departments, with metadata drawn directly from Borealis.\n- **Smart Filters** — quickly navigate by college, department, or campus.  \n- **Home Tab Summary** — at-a-glance metrics for available studies and datasets.\n- **View study-level summaries** - Gain insight into each dataset through high-level summary statistics, research objectives, study location, and associated keywords.\n- **Seamless navigation** — one-click access to Network or Data Explorer interfaces. \n\n---\n\n### 6.0 Getting Started\n\nVisit the [**Getting Started**](getting-started.qmd) to launch the RED‑X app, explore its structure, understand system requirements, and get a quick overview of how to navigate and begin using its core features.\n\n---\n\n### 7.0 Browse the Documentation\n\nUse the sidebar to navigate in sequence:\n\n1.
