However, much of this data remained siloed, inconsistently described, or difficult to navigate, making reuse a significant challenge.\n\nThe motivation behind RED-X came from a **workshop hosted by the University of Guelph in collaboration with Compute Ontario**, which focused on enhancing the **FAIRness** (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research data. Researchers, librarians, and data specialists at the event emphasized the need for a user-friendly tool that could help bridge the gap between stored data and actionable insight.\n\nRED-X was thus envisioned as a **web-based metadata and dataset discovery platform**, built using **RShiny**, that connects directly to **Borealis**, a Dataverse-based data repository platform.
