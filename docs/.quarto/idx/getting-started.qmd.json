It is designed to help researchers explore historical research data. RED-X connects to the [Borealis Dataverse](https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/ugardr) via Application Programming Interface (API). The retrieved data/information is stored in an embedded relational database to store and retrieve data efficiently. It updates automatically every 48 hours to provide an up-to-date metadata and research data.\n\n---\n\n### 2.0 Accessing RED-X\n\nYou can access the app directly through the following link:\nðŸ”— **[Launch RED-X](https://agrifooddatacanada.shinyapps.io/RED-X/)**  \n\n> **Note** : No installation or login is required. RED-X is optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile functionality is limited.\n\n---\n\n### 3.0 System Requirements\n\n- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n- Stable internet connection.\n- Recommended screen resolution: 1280Ã—720 or higher.\n\n---\n\n### 4.0 Overview of the Interface\n\nWhen you launch RED-X, youâ€™ll land on the **Home** tab, which provides an at-a-glance overview of the database contents. The layout includes a **carousel-style summary** displaying summary statistics like:\n\n\n- Connected dataverses\n- Total number of studies\n- Number of authors\n- Available keywords\n- Number of downloadable files\n\n![](images/RED-X_HOME.png)\n\nIt also introduces users to the two primary interactive tools like:\n\n####  4.1 Network Explorer \n\nThis tab allows you to explore **relationships between keywords, authors, departments, and colleges** using an interactive network graph. Itâ€™s designed to support discovery, literature and data review, and collaboration tracking.\n\n![](images/network tab.png){width=60%}\n\n#### 4.2 Data Explorer\n\nThis section allows users to **browse and filter studies**, view their metadata, raw data, summary statistic and visualize data. Filters are available by college, campus and institution.\n\n![](images/data tab.png){width=60%}\n\n---\n\n### 5.0 Data Refresh Cycle\n\nRED-X connects to the **Borealis Dataverse** using an API calls. Metadata and datasets are updated every 48 hours to ensure access to the most recent content available from contributing institutions.\n\n![](images/updates.jpg){width=50%}\n\n---\n\n### 6.0 Next Steps\n\n- Read the [User Guide](user-guide.qmd) for more detailed walkthroughs.\n- View the [System Architecture](architecture.qmd) to understand the backend and data flow.\n- Contact [adc@uoguelph.ca](mailto:adc@uoguelph.ca) for questions or support.\n\n---\n\n### 7.0 Want to Contribute?\n\nIf you're interested in the development process or contributing to the project, see the [Developer Guide](dev.qmd).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-after-body":["zoom.js"],"number-sections":false,"css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":5,"output-file":"getting-started.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"toc-title":"On this page","title":"Getting Started","description":"Learn how to access and explore research datasets using the RED-X platform."},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
