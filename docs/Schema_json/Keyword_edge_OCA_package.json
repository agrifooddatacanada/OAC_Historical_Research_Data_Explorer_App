Each row in this dataset represents a pair of keywords that co-occurred in one or more studies. The strength of this connection—i.e., how frequently the two keywords appeared together—is recorded as the weight. This dataset, along with the keyword node data, helps the RED-X app render an interactive network plot that reveals relationships between concepts across historical research metadata. Users can explore how different keywords are interlinked, which can support discovery and thematic clustering.","name":"Keyword edge"}]}},"dependencies":[]},"extensions":{"adc":{"EIPGhhHuEV444bds9VWdD6H8BsU6SM3fAAJFPWr-XY7s":{"d":"EBN_QSoyXn3_R9UbRJMGVZ4vsngltqRODdMaJGDXqsKi","type":"community/adc/extension/1.0","overlays":{"ordering":{"d":"EANxLAE0-kuJcZMSb1NFa-UoH2PLQDJ4gstD4TeAlLYt","type":"community/overlays/adc/ordering/1.1","attribute_ordering":["from","to","weight"],"entry_code_ordering":{}}}}}}}
