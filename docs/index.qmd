### 1.0 RED‑X (Re‑usable Data Explorer)

RED-X is a reusable data exploration app that helps users discover historical research data hosted on the Borealis Dataverse.It is a modern web application developed by Agri‑Food Data Canada (ADC) to provide researchers and data managers streamlined access to historical research data. It simplifies access to metadata, visualizes keyword/author relationships, and supports informed reuse of datasets. With version 2.0, RED‑X delivers faster performance, a broader institutional scope, and intuitive visual tools.

### 2.0 Background and Motivation

RED-X was developed in response to a growing need for **efficient access to historical research datasets**—particularly in the agricultural and environmental sciences. 

Over the years, large volumes of valuable data have been collected by researchers at the **University of Guelph**, especially through the **Ontario Agricultural College (OAC)**. However, much of this data remained siloed, inconsistently described, or difficult to navigate, making reuse a significant challenge.

The motivation behind RED-X came from a **workshop hosted by the University of Guelph in collaboration with Compute Ontario**, which focused on enhancing the **FAIRness** (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research data. Researchers, librarians, and data specialists at the event emphasized the need for a user-friendly tool that could help bridge the gap between stored data and actionable insight.

RED-X was thus envisioned as a **web-based metadata and dataset discovery platform**, built using **RShiny**, that connects directly to **Borealis**, a Dataverse-based data repository platform. The app provides both technical and non-technical users with intuitive tools for exploring, visualizing, and filtering datasets, enabling better use of existing research outputs and supporting data-driven collaboration across departments and institutions.
