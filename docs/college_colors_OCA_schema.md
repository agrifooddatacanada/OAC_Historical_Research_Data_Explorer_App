**Name**: college_colors  
**Description**: The college_colors file contains a color mapping for different college names. It plays a key role in the network visualization feature of the RED-X application, helping users distinguish between different colleges using color-coded nodes. Each keyword or author node inherits a color from this mapping based on its associated college. This improves visual clarity and makes it easier to spot patterns across institutions in the research network.
